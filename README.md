# RoBERTa-Model-train-on-a-custom-dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to effectively utilize the RoBERTa model—a variant of BERT optimized for robust performance—in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) improves upon BERT by training the model longer with larger batches, on more data, and without the next sentence prediction objective.

The notebook provides a practical guide on fine-tuning RoBERTa for text classification using transfer learning. It includes step-by-step instructions on how to adapt and apply the pretrained RoBERTa model to achieve state-of-the-art results in NLP tasks.
